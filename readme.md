It was really boring for me to do 3-4 rounds of the exact same workout, so I ended up generating
a set of integers from [random.org][2] and did few different workout routines.

This program basically does the same thing, but automagically.

True randomness is sourced from [random.org][2] service, you need to generate an [API key][3]
and save it as 'api.key' file to be able to use it.

Someday I'd like to generate my own entire workouts based on exercises that Jordan does in
his, and maybe create another project with custom timer and other fun stuff.


## TODO

- [x] Pretty printing the workout links with padding
- [ ] Separate the workouts by intensity
- [ ] Order the workouts in generated set by intensity (from most intense to least intense)
- [ ] Don't generate sets of all-intense or all-light workouts
- [ ] Generate a custom workout from single exercises
